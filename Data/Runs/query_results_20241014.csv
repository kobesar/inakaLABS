He emphasizes the need for an optimal energy mix, acknowledging the challenges of balancing economic growth with environmental sustainability.  While Ishiba recognizes the potential of geothermal power, he also highlights the need to navigate the complexities of utilizing this resource within protected natural areas.  This approach, while acknowledging the importance of environmental protection, prioritizes economic considerations.  At Inaka LABS, we believe in a different approach - one that prioritizes sustainable development, fostering innovation in rural areas to create a more resilient and environmentally responsible future for Japan.  Join us in exploring the potential of rural communities to lead the way in sustainable energy solutions.  #Japan #ClimateChange #RenewableEnergy #Sustainability #RuralDevelopment #inakaLABS","Ishiba's energy policy is stuck in the past.
